commit b8da53bfdf1e
Author: Dave Penkler <dpenkler@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Aug 22 11:26:10 2025 +0200

    Improve finding listeners ibln()
    
    When a device is addressed as listener it should assert NRFD and NDAC.
    When a device is ready for data it de-asserts NRFD.
    
    The original find listener protocol checked only for NDAC asserted.
    This suffices in most cases since fast devices might de-assert NRFD
    before the state of the handshake lines can be checked. However some
    older slow devices only assert NDAC after some delay but before
    de-asserting NRFD. Additionally checking for NRFD covers these devices
    also.
    
    To detect a listener, check for NRFD or NDAC asserted after addressing
    the device as listener.

Author: Dave Penkler <dpenkler@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat May 24 11:36:47 2025 +0200

    Fix xml related errors in sgml and add makefile stuff for man
    
    The man page generation was removed previously as the tables did
    not render properly. Michael Katzman has found a solution using
    osx and xsltproc. The stylesheet is placed in different locations
    depending on the distro so for now the man pages are not built
    by defauit. Its location must be specified in doc/Makefile.am
    before building the Makefiles. Then the manpages can be generated
    by '$ make man' in the doc directory.

Author: Dave Penkler <dpenkler@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue May 20 15:06:49 2025 +0200

    Fix sad bugs
    
      The MSA macro was using gpib_address_restrict which did
      not allow a secondary address of 31. Don't use the macro
      and just trim the address to 5 bits. Fix in kernel and
      user part copies of the gpib.h include file.
    
      In reinit_descriptor the secondary address sent to internal_ibsad
      was not adjusted to the 96-127 range causing secondary addressing
      to be disabled after the reinitialisation of the descriptor.

    Update board config from driver when adding interface
    
    If there is no interface definition in gpib.conf for a particular
    minor, we need to recover the pad, sad and system-controller
    configuration options from the driver that were put there by
    gpib_config from its command line so that the descriptor
    inserted for the minor has the the right parameters which are used
    for bringing the board on-line.
    
    Some additional checks in the parsing of gpib.conf and for
    config parameters of gpib_config.

Author: Dave Penkler <dpenkler@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 16 19:07:47 2025 +0200

    Add automatic configuration of minor
    
    When using udev scripts it is useful to be able to change the
    configuration of minors without editing the gpib.conf file.
    This is possible as the gpib_config options override the
    settings in gpib.conf. In order to configure a minor which is
    not present in gpib.conf the board-type and pad options to gpib_config
    must be specified as well as system-controller option if that is desired.
    
    A number of sanity checks have been added to the conf file parser.
    In particular device entries must have at least the minor, pad and
    name options specified.
    
    For and interface entry the minor is checked for validity as well
    as the presence of the pad option. The board_type option is not
    enforced in the config file but is checked in gpib_config.

    Use kernel gpib_ioctl.h include
    
    The kernel include removed the typedefs for the ioctls structs
    in compliance with kernel coding standards. This file is copied
    from the staging/gpib/uapi directory. While the kernel drivers
    are still in the staging directory this file will need to be synced
    with the kernel version.
    
    These changes replace the ioctl typedefs with the appropriate
    structs in the library functions and in the config programme.

commit 430225ced0e1
Author: Dave Penkler <dpenkler@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Apr 10 13:40:15 2025 +0200

    Add common include file from kernel staging directory
    
    gpib.h contains the kernel coding standard compatible identifiers
    used by the kernel code. While the kernel drivers are still in
    the staging directory this file will need to be synced with the
    kernel version.
    
    It is currently named gpib_user.h in the staging/gpib/uapi directory.
    It will be renamed to gpib.h eventually.
    
    gpib_user.h contains the definition of the backward compatible user-space
    defines and the enums and functions that are not used by the gpib kernel
    drivers.
    
    Makefile.am adds gpio.h to the files to install.

    Preliminary fix for CMPL being set incorrectly bug #87
       CMPL is being set after the address setup of an
       async read or write. This causes an ibwait waiting on
       the completion of the read or write to resynchronise
       (join) with the async thread immediately after the address
       setup, making it hang until the async read or write
       operation complete,  even if a timeout  has been set.
       As this can take quite some time it effectively
       nullifies the advantage of using async io.
    
       Patch  to suppress the setting of CMPL after the
       completion of the address setup operation of an
       ibrda or ibwrta request:
       - Introduce a field in async_operation to distinguish
         the type of aio in progress in my_ibcmd.
       - In my_ibcmd, if an async io is in progress and it is
         either a read or write then the end field is set in
         the IBCMD ioctl request.
       The end field is only used in ibrd as a return.
       It is reused in cmd to avoid adding a field to the
       read_write_ioctl_t structure.
       - This field is tested in the kernel space IBCMD ioctl
         handler to prevent the clearing of io_in_progress
         which suppresses the setting of CMPL in the status
         update.
